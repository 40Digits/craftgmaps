# A Simple Google Maps Field Type for CraftCMS

## Getting Started

I promise this will be filled in at some point

## Contributing

We encourage you to contribute to this plugin! Here are details how to set it up locally for development:

1. Setup a Craft install.
  * I have one local install that I use to develop all Craft plugins.
2. Fork this repo
3. Clone the forked repo to your local
  * We would suggest doing this outside of the Craft install
4. npm install
  * To build the Javascript run `npm run watch`
  * Uses babel and ES2015
5. Symlink the repo to your Craft install's plugin repo
6. Install in the admin interface
